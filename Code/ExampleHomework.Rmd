### Question 1
Chapter 2 Exercise 7

a. 
```{r}
x <- matrix(c(0, 2, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0,
              3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0,
              0, 0, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0),
            nrow = 7, ncol = 3)

dist(x)
```

b. Green, since observation 5 is closest to our test point and it has a Y value of Green.

c. Red, observations 2, 5, and 6 are closest to our test point and their Y values are Red, Green, and Red, respectively.

d. You should think about this one.

### Question 2 
Chapter ? Exercise ?

a. Here is another answer with some code.
```{r}
y <- c(3,6,23,7)
mean(y)
```
b. Repeating the same thing but showing the output only (no code).
```{r, echo = FALSE}
y <- c(3,6,23,7)
mean(y)
```

c. (Optional/advanced) Can show how the sample mean is calcualted using $\LaTeX: \bar{y} =\frac{\sum{y}}{n}$
